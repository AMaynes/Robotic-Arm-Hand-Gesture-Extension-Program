Dobot Applications:
	VR Tracking
	Leap Motion Improvements

PLANS:
	Abstract code to be usable for other arms (Different Tracking modes for existing Realtime compatible modes?)
	Make an interface that allows for adjusting variables as needed with noted recommended values based on arm & model
	Make compatible with horizontally oriented cameras
	Make it for more than 2 link arms, make it for 3-4 link too

Next Phase Plans:
	EEG Data Analysis for mind control modalities

Publications:
	Dobot gesture control for ASEE conference (In works)
	Dobot brain wave control (May combine with gesture control publication)
	Brain wave analysis/data-decomposition software/hardware method comparisons (May not have time)
